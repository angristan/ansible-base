# Ansible "base" role

This is a personal role that I apply on my servers to provide a "base" config.

It is made for Debian 9/10 and Ubuntu 18.04.

Feel free to inspire yourself from it.

## Usage

Add this to your `requirements.yml`:

```yml
- src: https://github.com/angristan/ansible-base
  version: vX.X.X
```
