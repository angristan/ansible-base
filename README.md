# Ansible "base" role

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/angristan/ansible-base.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/angristan/ansible-base)

This is a personal role that I apply on my servers to provide a "base" config.

It is made for Debian 9/10 and Ubuntu 18.04.

Feel free to inspire yourself from it.

## Installation

Add this to your `requirements.yml`:

```yml
